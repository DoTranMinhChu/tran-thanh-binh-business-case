            Porter's five forces are competitive rivalry, supplier power, buyer
            power, threat of substitution and threat of new entry. This model is
            unique because it gauges profitability by focusing less on the
            product or audience and more on outside influences and competition.
            Using this analysis can be a simple but powerful way to understand
            the competitiveness within your business environment. Here is a
            breakdown of the five forces:

          <p className="py-2 text-justify">
            STP stands for segmentation, targeting and positioning. It's a
            popular model that uses the top-down approach by focusing on how a
            company addresses customers. STP uses a four-step process to deliver
            relevant, personalized messages to targeted audiences. Top-down
            models like the STP marketing model have gained attractiveness over
            the years as companies pivot to delivering catered content to their
            target audiences via social media.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-justify">
            The first step is market segmentation, where marketers determine
            important characteristics for each group within the market. An
            example of market segmentation is dividing your market by age (e.g.:
            Gen Z, millennials, baby boomers, etc.). The next step is targeting.
            Decide which group or groups are the most receptive to your product
            and develop a detailed strategy to position your product or service
            to the chosen group.
